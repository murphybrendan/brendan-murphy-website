Hello! Welcome to my blog. I'm trying to transition my career towards [AI safety research engineering](https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/ai-safety-researcher/) because I believe AI poses a [significant existential risk](https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/artificial-intelligence/), and I believe I can apply my existing software engineering skills towards that problem. I post weekly updates on the things I've learned in the past week regarding AI safety as well as any random thoughts that I want to share.
